    <h2>Hello,</h2>
    <p> and thanks for stopping by! Here's a little background about myself: I was born and raised in Columbus,
        Ohio. I spent some time after high school
        exploring the country which allowed me to live in California, Arizona, and Hawaii, although I enjoyed my
        travels, I eventually ended back in Ohio.
        In my free time I enjoy spending my time outdoors. I love hiking, camping, kayaking, and trail running.
        I also enjoy traveling and love the ocean.
        I enjoy doing problem solving puzzles in my freetime, such as crosswords, sudoku, and logic puzzles.
        While I was going to college I was a little
        bit directionless in what I wanted to study, so I randomly took an entry-level computer science class,
        and that's when I fell in love with
        programming. I realized the true core of programming is problem-solving, so this seemed like the perfect
        career choice for me. Although I started
        my learning experience in college, I switched from college to We Can {Code} IT bootcamp, and it was the
        right decision for me. The change was
        refreshing, the instructors seem to truly care about our success, and the enviroment proved to be
        conducive to my learning style. This has prepared me
        for my career as a developer, and I'm excited to see what the future will bring.
