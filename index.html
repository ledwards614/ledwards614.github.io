<h2>My Story</h2></center>

<p>I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. I spent some time after high school
    exploring the country which allowed me to live in California, Arizona, and
Hawaii, although I enjoyed my travels, I eventually ended back in Ohio. In my 
free time I enjoy spending my time outdoors. I love hiking, camping, kayaking, 
and trail running. I also enjoy traveling and love the ocean. ....add some stuff
about my tech careeer</p>

<h3>Cats Are Awesome!  </h3>

Look at this one:
<!-- add appropriate image here (don't forget alt attribute!) -->
<img src="images/kitten.jpg" alt="An adorable Kitten">

<h3>Doggos Are Pretty Cool Too</h3>

<p>This doggo is a tricky doggo:</p>
<!-- add appropriate image here (don't forget alt attribute!) -->

    <h2>Sometimes people say important things</h2>
    <!-- description of next section -->
    <p>You need to document important things that people say so you can sound smart when it's necessary.</p>
    <!-- quote -->
    <blockquote>Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose. - Bill Gates</blockquote>

    <h2>When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just shouldn't do</h2>
    <!-- description -->
    <p>At least, not anymore...</p>

    <!-- title for next item -->
    <h3>Want bold text?</h3>
    <!-- make 'right way' bold first the wrong way, then the right way -->
    <p></p>There's a <b>wrong</b> way and a <strong>right </strong> way. Always use the right way!</p>



    <!-- title for next item -->
    <h3>Maybe you need some italics?</h3>
    <!-- make 'like this' italic using the wrong method. Make 'right way' italic using the correct method -->
    <p>Again, it used to be done like this. <i>This is wrong.</i> <em> This is the right way.</em></p>

    <!-- title for next item -->
    <h2>Separation of concerns</h2>
    <!-- description -->
    <p>The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used. HTML should be used to mark-up or organize your content. It should not be used to style your content or interact with it. Those are the jobs of CSS and JavaScript!

    <!-- title for next section -->
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <!-- make either 'place' in the next body of text a link to your favorite site. (keep it appropriate) -->
    <p>Links are one of the most important parts of the web. They help you navigate from <a href=https://google.com> place </a> to place on the internet.</p>

    <!-- title for next section -->
    Sections
    <!-- go back through and group each section correctly
        stretch: give each group a class that properly reflects what they represent -->
    Section elements are good for grouping elements that belong together. You can also use div's for this
